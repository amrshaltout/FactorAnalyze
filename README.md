# Factor Analysis with Python

## Overview
This Jupyter project demonstrates how to perform Factor Analysis using Python, particularly focusing on the factor_analyzer library. Factor Analysis is a statistical method used to identify underlying factors or latent variables that explain patterns of correlations within a dataset.

## Data
The dataset used in this project is stored in the file FactorAnalysis.csv. It contains [describe your dataset briefly, e.g., information about the variables, number of observations, etc.].

## Project Structure
- FactorAnalysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for performing Factor Analysis.
- FactorAnalysis.csv: Input dataset for the analysis.
- README.md: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Requirements
To run the Jupyter Notebook, you need the following Python libraries installed:

pandas
numpy
sklearn
factor_analyzer
matplotlib
seaborn
You can install these libraries using pip:

## Usage
1.Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.Open FactorAnalysis.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3.Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to perform Factor Analysis on the dataset.
4.[Add any specific instructions for users if needed.]

## Results
-The notebook generates factor scores and factor loadings, which can be interpreted to understand the underlying factors in the dataset.
-Visualization of correlation matrices helps in understanding the relationships between variables and factors.
